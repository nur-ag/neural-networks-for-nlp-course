    "Hopefully, this has given you an understanding of what a plane is: nothing but a direction shifted by some bias! With it, we have seen we can partition parts of space. Furthermore, the way we compute whether or not a point is in front of them is by performing the dot product of the direction vector and then adding up the bias. If the result is positive, we are in front; we are in the back if it is negative and in the middle of the plane if it is exactly 0.\n",
