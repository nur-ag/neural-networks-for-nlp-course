    "In the previous lesson we took a dive on Natural Language Processing using neural networks. Using sentiment analysis as our first task to work with, we tried several models to tackle it as much as we could. We did so incrementally, trying to simplify the problem as much as possible to ensure that it would fit in the neural networks we have seen so far. **This approach of coming up with the simplest possible solution is usually a good idea, because complicated models tend to be harder to develop and understand, as well as more expensive to train.** However, we finished the lesson with the clear understanding that some problems might need more involved machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also left four exercises to the reader, which you hopefully have put some time into. Since they were mostly exploratory in nature, we will not solve them here. However, we will sketch what you might have gotten from them so we can keep going:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the impact of dataset size, **the only clear-cut answer is that we really need training data!** After trying a few partition sizes for training and evaluating, you might have noticed that the learned weights were a lot noisier for smaller training sizes. This is normal: **the fewer training examples, the least likely it is that we will learn a proper representation.** Our dataset was very small, which accentuates this problem.\n",
    "2. Using a `Bag of Words` model that also encodes the frequency of words in a document might have some small effect, but for our dataset it did not matter much. **It is a good idea to revisit this approach for some of the more involved problems we will see now.**\n",
    "3. Because of the small dataset, **we need a high ratio of negative samples for the embeddings to make sense.** Lower ratios meant less powerful embeddings. On the other hand, higher ratios also mean more samples, and that has a direct impact on training speed!\n",
    "4. Finally, alternative words embeddings can better capture syntactic over semantic characteristics or vice-versa. As such, **they can outperform one another depending on the problem we are trying to solve!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is already too much of a retrospective! To set the stage, let's remember at the neural networks we have been working with so far:\n",

This structure can be plenty of things: a sequence of words, a matrix of colors, the frames of a video... The idea is that our neural network will learn to capture some property in the parts that form input. Then, we will aggregate and compress the representation to produce a higher understanding of what we are dealing with. **By stacking layers upon layers that encode and compress with this structure, we reach the point where we can easily classify it.**\n",

With these filters, we can aggregate the information from the concrete into the abstract: from lines we go into shapes, from shapes into textures, from textures we see materials and from materials we learn to classify concrete objects. **The networks that we use to process the groups of information at each level are the simplest amongst what we have seen**: single layer neural networks with a simple activation such as ReLU. The input for these little networks is the vector shown at the rightmost side of the image, which is itself the flattenned version of the third pixel patch on the top row.\n",

    "Typically, we introduce additional operations in the middle to further simplify our problem. These operations add another degree of non-linearity over the structure our networks process without adding additional learnable parameters. An example of this is computing the average or maximum over chunks, which is called pooling. The combination of the convolutional layers, which learn filters, and the pooling layers, which aggregate over them, is applied repeatedly. **At some point, the output is reduced to a few features that, hopefully, capture the nature of our problem and can be flattened and passed to a vector-hungry neural network.**  The general principles of the underlying machinery remain the same. \n",

    "Now onto the convolutional model we go! Convolutional networks are simple. As we said, at a given representation level we apply a series of filters of a given size, and then usually aggregate their results. In some cases, the windows for the filters may fall out of the ranges of the input. If they do, we can chose to discard them altogether or pad the values outside in some way. We can also chose to move the windows over each block in the input, or instead perform larger jumps, which is called the `stride`. The best way to understand this is by looking at the following picture:\n",

    "Here we have an structured input, perhaps the image of a tree tree in a sunny day for a classifier that tells the season of the year appart. We slide a $3 \\times 3$ pixel wide filter over the image (shaded overlay) to extract a series of features on a patch of the image (represented in cyan, with various features per 'piece'). The filters will be applied on all patches by sliding them over the whole image. This sliding can leap over pixels, as seen in the image. In this case we have a stride of 1, so we skip one pixel as often times the information one pixel apart is not very significant, striding our convolution. **Of course, the result of applying our filter over the image also has a spatial structure, so we can apply the same building blocks several times to learn increasingly complex patterns!**\n",

Then, we compute a final filter over groups of 3 adjacent outputs from the previous layer and average out the results. Finally, we capture the predictions with a single sigmoid output.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We are using **Convolution1D** layers—and as their name goes, they only run over a one-dimensional structure!\n",
    "2. Similarly to the image classification problem, **we have pooling functions to apply over the 1D patches**. We can apply either **Average or Maximum pooling**. Since we want to capture the overall sentiment of the document while keeping the model very simple, **we use Global pooling, which means applying the pooling operation over the whole structure!**\n",
    "3. Most of our parameters are coming from the embedding layer—the features we learn for each word. **The convolutional part of our model takes just a little over a hundred parameters!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have to discuss padding. We have set up the convolutional inputs with `same` as their padding mode. This means that the learned filters will be computed with windows that will slide through the whole input, including any necessary zero padding to cover the edges. Alternatively, we could have used `valid` which would have forced the windows to only contain inputs within the input. The two padding modes are more easily understood through images: \n",

    "<img src=\"images/ConvPadding.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Same and valid padding illustrated.\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image, 2 convolution windows of 3 elements with a stride of 3 (that is, one after the other and without overlaps!) process a 5-element input. `valid` padding will mean we only take the output of the first, green window because the second, red one includes an element which lies out of the input. If we use `same` as our padding mode, we will take both, padding the missing item with a vector of zeros."

    "The model we have designed does not surprise us! **We have simply put together a few of the layers we already know, our usual suspects.** Our convolutions this time are applied using `valid` padding, which we can easily see in the length of the output shapes changing. After stacking our bunch of convolutions, we build a final multi-class classifier. Remember that when we want to select a class out of many, we typically use a softmax output and categorical crossentropy as our loss function. **This way we build a model that predicts the individual probability of each class, in hopes that the highest probability will belong to the actual class!** \n",
    "\n",
    "We have included a new layer in the mix, though. This layer, called Dropout, is used to help our neural network generalize more. Dropout is one but many regularization techniques to improve general performance. Here, regularization means exactly that: achieving more general models. **Regularization techniques are helpful because very often our neural networks have so many parameters that they will pay too much attention to the training examples and overfit on them.** This means that the model they implement is not very general, because it will not apply beyond the training set. Using Dropout solves this by randomly dropping units at training time. Here, dropping means that they will not learn and that, instead, they will just pass a constant signal (typically zero). **This allows the model to learn more robust representations, since there must be multiple avenues for a signal to really be taken into account!** Dropout is easy to understand visually:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/DropoutDiagram.png\" width=\"900\" alt=\"An example application of Dropout, showing the skipped units in a deep neural network with 2 hidden layers. Dropped units will simply forward zeros, i.e., produce no tangible output.\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, dropping connections should make us think about the number of parameters in our model. **It should be clear from the picture that a model where we drop too many connections will not be able to learn.** Our model has 2 million parameters for the embeddings, but its convolutional components amount to just under a quarter million. Furthermore, we have kept the embeddings to be trainable. **Our embeddings not being trainable means that they may not be shared with other tasks and that they just act as background information when we begin training.** Is this setup enough to capture the classification problem? How much performance are we actually getting out of retraining the embeddings? Should we use a higher or lower dropout rate? \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, it is a good idea to answer those questions through experiments. Answering the first question will depend on what we expect from our models. Indeed, **enough will depend on how we measure performance and how far we want to get!** With that in mind, how do we measure how well we are classifying for a problem in which we have multiple classes? So far we have relied on accuracy, interpreted as counting the number of times we get a prediction correct out of all inputs we test. **However, this measure posses some problems: if our dataset is not balanced, a model that predicts just a single class might seem good enough!** Likewise, in a multiclass setting, we would want to have a breakdown of how well we are doing for each class—as we might underperform for some kinds of inputs, and we would want to improve on them!\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this purpose, we may use precision, recall and their combination, F1 score.** Precision is the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances we say belong to a class. Recall is the proportion of correctly classified instances of a class given all instances in that class. Finally, the F1 measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and can be understood as an aggregate metric to reduce both to a single value that can . **These metrics give us a per-class understanding of how well our model captures the class and how much it misses elements from it.** Let's compute them for our model:"

    "We can see that in general we do well enough, but for some classes we are missing the mark a bit. We will not go into the details, but it is a good idea to try to improve performance on classes for which we do poorly. In any case, now that we have a good way of visualizing the performance of our model, we can go back to our previous questions. We were wondering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Is the impact of retraining the word embeddings worth it?**\n",
    "2. **Could we improve our precision by using a higher or lower dropout rate?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**We could muse, think and wonder, but in the end experiments are the best way to settle these questions.** It is a good idea to give that a shot, and try the 4 possible embedding setups and different dropout rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking is good for figuring out limitations about our models, however. When we were using vanilla deep neural networks, our problem was that we could not capture the structure that an image or a document may have. **We solved this by introducing convolutional neural networks, which allow us to process the forming pieces of some continuous structure.** In that way, we can process chunks of pixels or groups of words... but is this enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "For natural language, it seems like we would need something more. Very often, the relationship between words can be far away. Consider the following sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The holiday resort, which has been open since the early 90s and only recently got renovated by its new management, sits on the side of a gorgeous polynesian beach.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to ask `what sits on the side of a polynesian beach?`, we would have to capture the long running relationship between the words that explain some fact about `the holiday resort`, our answer. Furthermore, we should understand that parts of that explanation are not the subject of sitting! As we would be looking as windows of tokens, it really should not surprise us if a model said that the `new management` were the ones sitting!\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with CNNs for text is that structure assumed is flat—we take words and fundamentally compute a weighted sum... **However, it is clear that our understanding of a word depends on how the word appears in the sentence.** In a sense, we could talk about the `state` of a word—the way in which it plays with the words that came before. After all, holiday resorts probably are not sitting on chairs!"

    "# Time is structure: Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way we ended the last section, you should already guess what we are going for. Although vanilla and convolutional neural networks are very powerful, in a sense we are still missing some basic building block. **We are dealing with sentences or documents, which are ordered lists of words—and the order matters!** Ideally, we would want a model that understands that `blue` coming before `sky` is not the same as it appearing after `feeling`! **More generally, our ideal model would keep track of what it has seen so far, and this in turn would let it appropriately \"read\" what we are trying to say.**\n",
    "\n",
    "How could such a model be implemented? The models we have seen so far always take the data as it is, without any reference to their own output. However, when we are processing things that have an order, things that flow in some given direction, we need to be able to do that kind of remembering. This is what Recurrent Neural Networks do: keeping track of state. **Recurrent Neural Networks (or RNNs) extend the same plain old vanilla neural networks with input state vectors that represent our knowledge up to a point.** This is best seen visually:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/RecurrentNetwork.png\" width=\"1000\" alt=\"A side-by-side look at a traditional neural network and a recurrent neural network. The recurrent neural network can be seen as a vanilla neural network whose output is used as part of its input in successive states!\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram actually hides away a good chunk of complexity. **Although simple RNNs as such have been used, they typically have problems dealing with long sequences and can be generally hard to train.** This is because the propagation of the errors, due to the simple self-referential nature of the design, ends up either exploding (going to infinity) or vanishing (going to zero). Modern RNN architectures involve some other transformations on the input and state vectors to keep this from happening. Since we are focusing on using them, however, we just have to be happy that researchers have carried us to this point!\n",
    "\n",
    "So with this idea in mind, we must give recurrent networks a shot! **Because of how they are defined, they are very well suited to our problem: the input to a recurrent network will be a sequence of vectors.** As we have been doing up to this point, this means we can use a padded $(N \\times d)$ matrix of up to $N$ states with embedding word vectors of dimension $d$. Depending on whether our task is to talk about every state or about the whole document, we can then use the whole set of output states or just the last one. Let's look at our 20 newsgroups classification problem, using the same pretrained GloVe embeddings and a modern RNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Training this model can take some time if you don't have a CUDA-compatible GPU. On a late 2015 MacBook Pro, it takes 1-hour of training time for 25 total epochs.\n",

    "Those results look quite promising! **Looking only at the recurrent part of the model, we are getting close to the performance of our convolutional classification model—with 6 times less parameters!** Of course, you may have noticed that this network took longer to train. After all, we had to train for 25 epochs instead of the 10 epochs we needed for our Convolutional Network! This is because Recurrent Neural Networks perform their processing sequentially and have to learn to keep track of the state. **Their sequential nature means that they cannot be easily parallelized, which in turn has an obvious impact on performance.** Furthermore, managing the interaction between states is no easy task, with vanilla RNNs usually having poor short term memory. This means that longer sequences become hard to train on, since the network is not able to keep up with the information contained across the states.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last problem is the reason why we have used the LSTM, which stands for Long Short Term Memory. **LSTMs manage to process longer sequences by processing the inputs through a series of small networks, called gates, that let them keep and forget specific parts of the state, the input and the output.** There is no need to describe the details of the gating mechanism, but you may understand it as component-wise probabilities of keeping, forgetting or outputting each of the vector features. Another similarly designed and used network is the GRU, which stands for Gated Recurrent Unit. **The GRU simplifies the gating by merging some of these small networks together to further reduce the number of parameters.**\n",

    "In either case, it is a good idea to go over the idea of RNNs as an abstraction. **Recurrent nets go through a list of states sequentially, and they do so in one direction.** However, in some cases the relationships between words can be a hard to capture if we are reading sequentially. One trivial extension is to read in both directions: this is aptly named a *bidirectional* RNN. Bidirectional RNNs are often used in Natural Language problems because the relationships between words can happen in either direction:\n",

But before jumping onto those, we have to have one final discussion about recurrent neural networks: can RNNs be composed? Our diagrams and our code give us different responses. In our abstract examples, we are processing each input one at a time and outputting something. **The result, then, should always be a sequence with as many vectors as there were inputs in the original sequence. However, looking at our code, the RNN layer is just producing a final output vector.** What gives? Well, turns out both things make sense! Keras by default makes RNN layers return the last output they produced. However, we can make our RNNs return sequences very easily, by simply passing the `return_sequences=True` argument!

We can combine the output of convolutional layers with a recurrent layer on top, and in that way attempt to capture both ngrams and long term relationships. We could output not just single class predictions, but predictions over whole sequences — and then learn to translate, answer questions or generate text. In short, we really can do a lot now!\n",

    "### Exercise 1: Evaluating model parameters.\n",
    "> Machine Learning models tend to have many possible options to control how the learning is performed and to adjust different settings of the underlying algorithms. These settings are called hyperparameters, and determine the actual parameters that the model learns — hence the name. **In the case of neural networks, we can choose activation functions, layers to use, number of layers, units per layer, the interaction between successive layers as a whole... That is, we have a ton of hyperparameters!** When we are designing our model for a particular task, we obviously want to make sure that it is well suited for it, and the best way to do this is through experiment.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> One common way of finding reasonable parameters is called [Grid search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization#Grid_search). **Grid search is simple process: we perform an exhaustive search over some set parameters, and select the best with respect to some metric.** Consider the convolutional neural network architecture that we designed, and assume that our layers, number of units per layer and layer interactions are fixed. Try to find reasonable values for the dropout rate, whether or not to use pretrained embeddings and whether or not to retrain those embeddings. Specifically, your task is to evaluate the following set of hyperparameters:\n",
    "> > ```python\n",
    "> > dropout_rates = [0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5]\n",
    "> > glove_options = [True, False]\n",
    "> > retrain_options = [True, False]```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **To compare each of the models, you could either use the validation accuracy or the validation loss.** In the case of accuracy, we will chose the model reaching the highest value of all of them. On the contrary, in the case of our loss function, we will chose the model that reaches the lowest possible value. As a reminder, the loss function is the error function we minimize during learning, so lower is better.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **HINT #1:** You can do this by calling the `train_conv_20news` function with different parameters. Notice that the function returns both the model and a history object. You can do look at the function definition [here](#Evaluating-model-parameters-[Exercise-1]).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **HINT #2:** To access the training statistics, you can make use of the [`History`](https://keras.io/visualization/#training-history-visualization) object returned by Keras when calling `model.fit` or `model.fit_generator`: `hst = model.fit(X, y, ...)`. You can access the per-epoch metrics by accessing the `history` dictionary in the object: `hst.history['val_acc']` will get the list of per-epoch validation accuracies.\n",

    "> We have explored Recurrent Networks as models that process a sequence in one direction. **However, language is a sequence with references all over the place!** Indeed, a word can be talking about something that appears before or after it. **This structure is at times modelled as a tree, and linguists enjoy those syntax parse trees very much.** The problem is that often we do not have access to the parse structure, or want a model that learns the structure along the way!\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Bidirectional Recurrent Networks make sense in this case, because they can learn dependencies going in either direction. Of course, this means learning two Recurrent Networks — one in each direction! **In turn, this means that our model may take even longer to converge, because we are increasing the number of features to train, processing what amounts to two different sequences!** To get a sense of what we mean, modify our simple implementation of the LSTM-based Recurrent classifier to be bidirectional. **Remember: you may need to further increase the number of training epochs! How does your Bidirectional model compare with an unidirectional LSTM?**\n",

    "> **OPTIONAL:** Do we now have too many parameters? Could we try to regularize the weights using the dropout options that the [LSTM layer](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#lstm) has to offer? Try to answer as many of these questions as you can after implementing your Bidirectional model: the more curious you get, the better your intuition will be!\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **HINT:** You can do this by importing [`Bidirectional`](https://keras.io/layers/wrappers/#bidirectional) from `keras.layers` and applying it over the recurrent layer (in our case, a LSTM) so that our model calls `Bidirectional(RNN(params...))(previous_layer)`.
